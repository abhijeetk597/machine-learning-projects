    "\n",
    "The purpose of this experiment is to establish a baseline for a domain-driven model and to compare it to more sophisticated machine learning models using baseline features. Without collaboration with stakeholders or additional predictors such as customer tenure, lifetime value, historical response rate etc our baseline model will simply follow our intuited rule:\n",
    "> Include the customer if they responded positively to the previous marketing campaign. If there were not enough respondents to use up the entire budget then randomly sample the training set for additional instances to ensure that the maximum number of customers are included.\n",
