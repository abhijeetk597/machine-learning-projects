# ðŸšœ Predicting the Sale Price of Bulldozers using Machine Learning

In this notebook, we are building an ML model with the goal of predicting the sale price of bulldozers.

The data and evaluation metric we'll be using is from Kaggle Competition [Blue Book for Bulldozers](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers/overview)

## 1. Problem Definition

> How well can we predict the future sale price of a bulldozer, given its characteristic previous examples of how much similar bulldozers have been sold for?

## 2. Data

Looking at the [dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers/data), we can see it's a time series problem.

In this case, it's a historical sales data of bulldozers. Including details like model type, size, sale data and more.

## 3. Model

After basic EDA, Random Forest Regressor model from Scikit-Learn Library was trained to predict bulldozer prices.
